Migration Guide
===============

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new version of the JavaScript API is based on `Openlayers 3 <http://ol3js.org/>`_ only. The previous version was based on OpenLayers 2 and ExtJS 3. The new JavaScript API aims to support the mapping part and doesn't provide any UI elements except the one provided by OpenLayers 3.
You are therefore free to choose the JavaScript framework you want to use for the creation of UI elements.

API Loader
~~~~~~~~~~

As in previous version, the `API loader <http://api3.geo.admin.ch/loader.js>`_ loads all necessary CSS and JavaScript ressources. The loader is language dependent (?lang=fr parameter can be used, for example).
