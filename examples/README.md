HOW-TO
======


Create/modify a pen
-------------------

[Code pen documentation](//blog.codepen.io/documentation/)

All codpens have been created with the account `geoadmin` (code stored at the same place as usual). Everybody with an
access can modify it, so BE CAREFUL.

The pens are defined with the `auto-save` functionnality to false, so don't forget to save your changes.


Export to gist
--------------

The code pen `geoadmin` account is linked to github account of `iwibot`.
If you use the [Export to gist](http://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/) functionality, the codepen will be saved on [`iwibot` gist account.](https://gist.github.com/iwibot).
So don't worry if you have broken the example we can retrieve an older version from gist.
